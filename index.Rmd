# **Hello there!**

My name is Clayton Snyder.

I'm 27 years old, quickling reaching 28. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. After a brief stint as an ex-patriot (in Montreal, Canada) I ended up moving back to my hometown of Brooklyn.

I enjoy watching movies (especially documentaries and horror), playing video games, basketball, billiards, and I listen to all genres of music ([Khruangbin](https://khruangbin.bandcamp.com/) being my current favorite). 

I absolutely love pizza, and being from Brooklyn I have strong opinions about where to find the best pizza (it's [here](https://www.difarapizzany.com/)). 

I am currently in school for an MPH in Biostatistics at Columbia University, which is going so far so good!
